Go into the folder of the project, use `npm i` or `yarn` to build the node modules.
Start the dev server using `npm start` or `yarn start`


You will Find - 
1. A gsap animation for the brand Logo,
2. ModalTrigger Component, below the logo, capaple of taking and modal and displaying it in the center of the page.
3. The Modal component itself, which can be close by the X button, clicking outside the modal area/on the backdrop, and by escape key on the keyboard.
4. If you dont have Metamask extension, you are taken to the page to install it, once the user installs/create an account, they can login.
5. On Open modal trigger, the user will get a prompt to either connect to metamask if not already connected - or - to switch to polygon network if connected
6. The UI for the token transfer is quite similar to the uniswap's, and you will understand why when you see the code :P.
7. I've focused on the UI and not so much on getting the users assets details and building the swap functionality.
8. I have created a 
I have not written tests, ive been working with extremely young start upsin the last few years, and inm not hand on on writing tests unfortunately.LineStatus component as well but didnt wire it completely die to lack of time, i will neeed to debug a bit for that.
9. I created the ModalManager component assuming the bare basic requirements, please let me know if you wanted a specific case, that i have missed. I will update the code. In previous organisations where i had to manage multiple modals on different pages, i had used local storage to track the modals states. 
10. Ive updated the favicon, to a logo from google, and added a random header for the page for now.
11. I have used typescript 
12. I have used TailwindCSS
13. I WAS NOT ABLE TO WRITE TESTS | NOT HANDS-ON | LAST TEST I WROTE WAS IN 2020 | SORRY | CAN REVISE IT QUICKLY THOUGH.
14. I will be deploying this via github.
15. I wanted to create a lot of code into custom hooks eg, global keyboard and mouse events.
16. I will soon add the npm package of this test and updated the readme again.
17. ive created a npm package for this app which can be installed in node modules using the command `npm i @aravindbairwa/zeroxpasshomepage` name of the package is `@aravindbairwa/zeroxpasshomepage` , it still has some issues to iron out though.


Thankyou
